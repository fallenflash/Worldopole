		While our staff operates completely on a volunteer basis and we do not accept payment
		for our time, there are however, costs to run several third party services such as "Proxies" and
		"reCAPTCHA support". We have not had to ask for 
		donations since our first round in the beginning of fall as the outstanding support has been enough until now.
		A donation of any size will of course help, however we are now offering a 
		special Donation Role in Discord for donations greater than $10.00. If you wish to be recognized just include your discord username.&#42;

		This is a project we want to take on, but it is completely reliant on donations from you guys.
		To determine the IV level of a Pokemon we need Trainer account’s level 30+, and a lot of them. 
		There are some for sale online. If you would like to see this, please consider donating a little
		extra and adding a note in the PayPal memo that you would like to see some of the donation put towards
		IV scanning. The Pokemon selected for IV scanning will be picked based on the current top tier attacker’s and defender’s.
